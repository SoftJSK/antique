TOP PRIORITY:
adding a shell - aqsh
adding a reboot function
adding a filesystem
STANDARD UTILITIES TO BE ADDED:
ls - directory listing, can also be called with the command "dir"
cd - change directory
read - read contents of a text file
zar - text editor
shutdown - pretty obvious
reboot - also obvious
print - like echo
